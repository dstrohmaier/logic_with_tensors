# Simulating Basic Logic with Tensors

This repository includes a Python Jupyter Notebook exploring how to simulate basic logic with tensors. It largely reproduces a 2013 paper by Edward Grefenstette, adding only a few examples. 

How to connect tensor representations of lexical meaning with their role in formal semantic remains an open research question. Grefenstette's work suggested some important connections, but is far from the last word on these issues.
